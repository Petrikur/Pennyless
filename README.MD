The Budget App is a simple mobile application i am developing with React Native. It allows users to track their expenses and incomes, and filter their balances by date range. The app features an intuitive user interface that makes it easy to add new transactions, categorize them, and view a summary of their spending. 

App is currently developed towards android platform and im planning to do IOS also later.
